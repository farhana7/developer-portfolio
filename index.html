          Jumong (Korean: 삼한지-주몽 편; Hanja: 三韓志-朱蒙篇; RR:
          Samhanji-Jumong Pyeon; lit. "The Book of the Three Hans: Described as
          the son of the heavens, Jumong was the founding king of Goguryeo,
          which eventually became the largest dynasty in Korean history. Also
          known as the Holy King of the East, mythological tales of his origins
          mostly follow the same basic story.The Chapter of Jumong") is a South
          Korean historical drama series that aired on MBC from 2006 to 2007 as
          the network's 45th anniversary special. Originally scheduled for 60
          episodes, MBC extended it to 81 because of its popularity. The series
          examines the life of Jumong, founder of the kingdom of Goguryeo. Few
          details have been found in the historical record about Jumong, so much
          of the series is fictionalized. The fantastic elements surrounding the
          original Jumong legend (such as those concerning his birth) have been
          replaced with events more grounded in reality. Jumong is considered
          part of the Korean Wave (Hallyu), with viewer ratings in Iran
          exceeding 80 percent.

        <h1>History Rule</h1>
        <h2>Became a King</h2>
        <p>
          In 37 BC, Jumong and his second wife Soseono established Goguryeo and
          became its first King and Queen. During that same year, King Songyang
          (Korean: 송양; Hanja: 松讓) of Biryu surrendered to him after
          receiving assistance in defeating the Mohe people's invasion. In 34
          BC, along with the palace, Goguryeo's first capital city Jolbon, was
          completed. Four years later, in 28 BC, Jumong sent General Bu Wiyeom
          (Korean: 부위염; Hanja: 扶尉厭) to conquer the Okjeo.[17][18] During
          that same year, Jumong's mother, Lady Yuhwa, died in the palace of the
          Eastern Buyeo, and was given the burial ceremony of a queen consort
          even though she was only a concubine. Jumong sent a messenger and
          numerous gifts to King Geumwa in gratitude for King Geumwa's
          generosity. In 19 BC, Jumong's first wife Lady Ye, fled Eastern Buyeo
          with their son Yuri to Goguryeo. At that time, Jumong's second wife
          Soseono was queen. When Lady Ye and Yuri arrived in Goguryeo, Soseono
          gave up her title after realizing that Jumong would make Yuri the
          Crown Prince and decided to leave Goguryeo. Soseono left Goguryeo with
          her two sons and some of her subordinates and headed further south
          into the Korean Peninsula into what is now South Korea. There she
          established Baekje. Jumong selected his first son, Yuri as the
          successor to the throne.

          <p>
            Jumong's kingdom of Goguryeo eventually evolved into a great
            regional territory with considerable power and influence. Goguryeo
            existed for 705 years and was ruled by 28 consecutive emperors of
            the Go Dynasty until it was conquered by the Silla-Tang alliance in
            668. Balhae and Goryeo succeeded Goguryeo, and the modern
            descendants of Jumong still bear his family name of "Go." In
            Goguryeo, Jumong was deified into an ancestral deity and he was
            worshipped in the Temple of King Dongmyeong next to his tomb.
