                Described as the son of the heavens, Jumong was the founding king of Goguryeo, which eventually became
                the largest dynasty in Korean history. Also known as the Holy King of the East, mythological tales of
                his origins mostly follow the same basic story.The
                Chapter of Jumong") is a South Korean historical drama series that aired on MBC from 2006 to 2007 as the
                network's 45th anniversary special. Originally scheduled for 60 episodes, MBC extended it to 81 because
                of
                its popularity.

                The series examines the life of Jumong, founder of the kingdom of Goguryeo. Few details have been found
                in
                the historical record about Jumong, so much of the series is fictionalized. The fantastic elements
                surrounding the original Jumong legend (such as those concerning his birth) have been replaced with
                events
                more grounded in reality. Jumong is considered part of the Korean Wave (Hallyu), with viewer ratings in
                Iran
                exceeding 80 percent.</p>

            <h1>History Rule</h1>
            <h2>Became a King</h2>
            <p>In 37 BC, Jumong and his second wife Soseono established Goguryeo and became its first King and Queen.
                During
                that same year, King Songyang (Korean: 송양; Hanja: 松讓) of Biryu surrendered to him after receiving
                assistance
                in defeating the Mohe people's invasion. In 34 BC, along with the palace, Goguryeo's first capital city
                Jolbon, was completed. Four years later, in 28 BC, Jumong sent General Bu Wiyeom (Korean: 부위염; Hanja:
                扶尉厭)
                to conquer the Okjeo.[17][18] During that same year, Jumong's mother, Lady Yuhwa, died in the palace of
                the
                Eastern Buyeo, and was given the burial ceremony of a queen consort even though she was only a
                concubine.

                Jumong sent a messenger and numerous gifts to King Geumwa in gratitude for King Geumwa's generosity. In
                19
                BC, Jumong's first wife Lady Ye, fled Eastern Buyeo with their son Yuri to Goguryeo. At that time,
                Jumong's
                second wife Soseono was queen. When Lady Ye and Yuri arrived in Goguryeo, Soseono gave up her title
                after
                realizing that Jumong would make Yuri the Crown Prince and decided to leave Goguryeo. Soseono left
                Goguryeo
                with her two sons and some of her subordinates and headed further south into the Korean Peninsula into
                what
                is now South Korea. There she established Baekje. Jumong selected his first son, Yuri as the successor
                to
                the throne.</p>
