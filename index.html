            <p>Jumong (Korean: 삼한지-주몽 편; Hanja: 三韓志-朱蒙篇; RR: Samhanji-Jumong Pyeon; lit. "The Book of the Three Hans:
                Described as the son of the heavens, Jumong was the founding king of Goguryeo, which eventually became
                the largest dynasty in Korean history. Also known as the Holy King of the East, mythological tales of
                his origins mostly follow the same basic story.The
                Chapter of Jumong") is a South Korean historical drama series that aired on MBC from 2006 to 2007 as the
                network's 45th anniversary special. Originally scheduled for 60 episodes, MBC extended it to 81 because
                of
                its popularity.

                The series examines the life of Jumong, founder of the kingdom of Goguryeo. Few details have been found
                in
                the historical record about Jumong, so much of the series is fictionalized. The fantastic elements
                surrounding the original Jumong legend (such as those concerning his birth) have been replaced with
                events
                more grounded in reality. Jumong is considered part of the Korean Wave (Hallyu), with viewer ratings in
                Iran
                exceeding 80 percent.</p>
